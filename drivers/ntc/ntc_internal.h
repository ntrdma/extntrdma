 * ntc_ctx_hello() - exchange data for upper layer protocol initialization
 * @ntc:	Device context.
 * @phase:	Hello phase number.
 * @in_buf:	Hello input buffer.
 * @in_buf:	Hello input buffer size.
 * @out_buf:	Hello output buffer.
 * @out_buf:	Hello output buffer size.
 *
 * In each phase, provide an input buffer with data from the peer, and an
 * output buffer with data for the peer.  The inputs are from the peer previous
 * phase outputs, and the outputs are for the peer next phase inputs.  Return
 * the size of a buffer for the peer next phase outputs, and the local phase
 * after next inputs.
 *
 * The zero'th phase has no inputs or outputs, and returns the size of the
 * buffer for the peer phase one outputs, which will be the local phase two
 * inputs.
 *
 * The first phase has only outputs, which will be the peer phase two inputs.
 * Phase one returns the size of the buffer for peer phase two outputs, which
 * will be the local phase three inputs.  The second and later phases have both
 * inputs and outputs, until the final phases.
 *
 * If a phase returns zero, then the next phase has no outputs.  The next phase
 * is the last phase.  Likewise, the last phase must return zero, or an error
 * code, only.
 *
 * When the next phase (logically, after the last phase) has no inputs or
 * outputs, initialization is complete.  After initialization is complete on
 * both sides of the channel, a link event will be indicated to the upper
 * layer, indicating that the link is up.
 *
 * The input buffer size is the capacity of the buffer, although the peer may
 * have written less data than the buffer size.  Likewise, the output buffer
 * size is the capacity of the buffer on the peer.  It is the responsibility of
 * the upper layer to detect and handle any cases where the data in the buffer
 * is less than the capacity of the buffer.
 *
 * Return: Input buffer size for phase after next, zero, or an error number.

 * down, a hardware link may still be active.  Immediately deallocating data
 * buffers could result in memory corruption, as it may be used by the peer
 * after it is freed locally.  A coordinated protocol reset is therefore
